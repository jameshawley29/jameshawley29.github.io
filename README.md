testing github web hosting

This project was created for fun to test some of the things that I have learned over the years from doing other projects. This is a web app that connects to my schools API so that it is completely automated. Using MongoDB I have connected this webpage to there services creating my own no sql database to which I connect and query from. I hope to be able to expand upon this to really improve my school and create a lasting product that the school can use even when I graduate.
